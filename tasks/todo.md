# Plan — Work tab: the ladder question, and three bugs found answering it — 2026-08-22 — DONE

## The ladder question: already handled, my earlier claim was wrong

I told the user BBQ's save "can't reach the capstones without a migration".
Not true. `repairGameState` (`utils/saveValidation.ts` ~line 904) already
reconciles every saved ladder against the catalog on load — it adopts the
catalog `levels` whenever the catalog is LONGER, preserves level/progress/
raiseMultiplier, and clamps the level index. It runs on every load path
(`loadGame` and CloudSync both go through `hydrateLoadedState` → repair), and
it is covered by `__tests__/actions/careerPromotionGating.test.ts`.

Verified by probe: a 6-rung surgeon save comes back with 8 rungs, level index 4
("Surgical Director") intact, repair logged. So BBQ's "Lv 5/6" is simply a
build that predates the capstone rungs; the next update fixes it with no work
from us. Nothing to do — and the git history here is a shallow clone rooted at
0a8fd34, which is why `git log -S` appeared to date both changes to one commit.

## What the search DID turn up — all three in the reported family

- [x] **A. The "Current Job" hero shows base pay next to the raise percentage.**
      `work.tsx:952` `currentJobSalary = currentJobLevel?.salary` — raw base,
      rendered at :1009 as `$13,000/wk · Lv 5/8 · +100%`. It prints the base and
      the premium side by side without applying one to the other. This is the
      most prominent income surface on the screen, and the previous commit made
      it worse by fixing the card below it and not this. → `paidWeeklyCareerSalary`.

- [x] **B. Three careers render nowhere.** `work.tsx:917`
      `advancedIds = ['politician', 'celebrity', 'athlete']` excludes them from
      "Standard Careers", but the "Advanced Careers" section iterates
      `ADVANCED_CAREERS`, which is `ceo · research_scientist ·
      creative_director · investment_banker · surgeon` — a different set. So
      politician, celebrity and athlete are filtered out of the only screen that
      can apply for them. All three are live content: achievements read their
      level (`achievementsData.ts`), ambitions read them (`POLITICS_CAREERS`,
      `FAME_CAREERS`), and `events/engine.ts:524` gates an event on holding one.
      → exclude the ids the Advanced section actually renders.

- [x] **C. The five real advanced careers render TWICE once applied.** They are
      pushed into `gameState.careers` on apply, so they pass the `basicCareers`
      filter and render via `renderCareerCard` (real level, real pay, "Manage
      Job"), AND again from the catalog via `renderAdvancedCareerCard` at
      `levels[0].salary` with the button "Working". For BBQ that is
      "Surgical Director $26K/wk" and "Resident $1,150/wk" on one screen — a 22x
      disagreement, which is exactly the report. → one card per career: the
      Advanced section delegates to `renderCareerCard` for a career the player
      has already applied to or holds, and keeps the catalog stub only for ones
      they have not.

- [x] D. `renderAdvancedCareerCard`'s reward is `$${salary.toLocaleString()}/wk`
      off `levels[0]` — a fourth money format with no multipliers. → same
      `formatMoney(paidWeeklySalaryForLevel(...))` as everywhere else.

- [x] E. Test + full verification.

## Verification
- `type-check` ✓ · `type-check:tests` ✓ · `lint:errors` ✓ · `check:routes` ✓
- Full Jest: **621 suites / 8136 tests pass**, 308 snapshots, 1 skipped.
- New `__tests__/economy/workTabCareerLists.test.ts` (9) — pins the PARTITION,
  not the literal: the derived id set matches the catalog, the two catalogs are
  disjoint, and every catalogued career lands in exactly one list.
- New case in `__tests__/save/hydrateLoadedState.test.ts` — the ladder question
  answered end to end. `careerPromotionGating` already covered `repairGameState`
  in isolation; what was uncovered is the step AFTER it, where this function
  merges onto `initialGameState` and could have taken `careers` from the wrong
  side and undone the repair silently. Both load paths run through here.
